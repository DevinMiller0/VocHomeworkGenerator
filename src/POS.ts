//  In this code, we have defined several lists that categorize different word types such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Each list contains a set of strings representing the abbreviations or full names of the corresponding word type.
//   The comments added explain the purpose of each list and provide information about the abbreviations or full names associated with each word type.
//   The module exports all the lists so that they can be used in other modules or files.

// Define lists of different word types/POS.
